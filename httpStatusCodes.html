		<span>Some of the most common status codes samples on web are:<br/><br/>
		403 – Forbidden which means, the server can accept the request but refused to take/make an action<br/>
		<br/>
		404 – The request to the server cannot fulfill because the resource cannot be found or is unavailable.<br/>
		<br/>
		500 – When the server cannot be process the request as of the moment.<br/>

	<li class="contents">
	Status codes are issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server. IETF RFC gives the codes used in some common applications of the HTTP. The standard classes of codes is listed in a numerical identity and are described in a human-readable phrases or otherwise codes based on the standards in RFC 7231. These codes are separated into five classes. 
	<br/><br/>According to RFC 7231 the codes being described are: 
	<br/><br/>
	1XX – Informational (The request was received, continuing process)<br/>
	2XX – Successful (The request was successfully received, understood, and accepted)<br/>
	3XX – Redirection (Further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request)<br/>
	4XX - Client Error (The request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled)<br/>
	5XX - Server Error (The server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request)<br/>
	<br/>
	Conclusion: These codes are given and standardized to be a helping tool to troubleshoot the issues or describe the current behavior of your web application(s). There are many common solutions that can be found on the web resources and guide you to familiarize these status codes and save more time in the development.
